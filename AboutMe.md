Hello, World!

My name is Alexandra McGill. I am currently completing my Professional Science Master's in Geospatial Data Science from Temple University. I obtained a Bachelor of Science in Community and Regional Planning with Honors from Iowa State University. I have an interest in development, historic preservation, transporation, and sustainability. In my free time I love to cook, ride my bike, and walk my dog Layla.
